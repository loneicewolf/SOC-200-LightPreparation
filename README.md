My (currently only in theory) light preparation for the SOC-200 course (will probably take it **sometime** )
https://www.offensive-security.com/soc200-osda/


Note taking apps I will make use of:
## Trillium
## Obsidian (in a enclosed-qube in qubes os) (since it's not open source)
## CherryTree
## Joplin
